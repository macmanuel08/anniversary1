          Thank you for support on me. Thanks for comforting me especially in my darkest times. Most of all, thanks for understanding on my frailties. Thank you for choosing to love me every single day.

          Sorry for my weaknesses. Sorry for being annoying sometimes. Sorry for being strict and hard on you sometimes. Sorry for the pains I've cause on you. But 'least know that I love you so much!

          I’m not a man full of promises to you, but I choose to take all my promises to our Heavenly Father in striving to become a better man for you and a capable father for our future children.

          You are such a wonderful woman that I've ever met. You are beautiful inside out (I'm not flattering you).
        </p>
        <p>
          You are the woman I always seek of to be with in this time and in eternity. Your beauty has been more visible in our first year.

          I can't imagine the day I will bring you and lay our hand on the altar inside the temple and make covenants to our Heavenly Father and promises for us and our future family.

          I'm grateful for the Atonement and Restored Gospel of Jesus Christ. But those things will become meaningless without you. I want to spend my time and eternity with you and have the blessings of Heavenly Father's plan of happiness.
